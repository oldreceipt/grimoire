/**
 * Unified Deadlock NPR material builder (the Phase 0/1 single build pass).
 *
 * This is the one-build-pass replacement for the old two-pass
 * applySource2MaterialHints + wrapMaterialWithNpr pipeline. It collapses both
 * into a single call that:
 *   1. clones the GLTF base material into a material WE OWN (the base is NEVER
 *      mutated, so teardown is just dispose + restore the original reference),
 *   2. decides ALL Source 2 material state once on that owned clone (glass /
 *      translucent / additive / self-illum / sheen / backfaces / unlit / jitter),
 *   3. wraps the owned clone in the CSM carrying the cel + rim + tint + self-illum
 *      scroll GLSL (reused verbatim from source2NprMaterial.ts).
 *
 * Because the CSM is handed the throwaway owned clone (never the live GLTF base),
 * CSM's in-place onBeforeCompile / __csm mutation lands on the clone we own and
 * dispose, so unwrapNprBase is NOT needed on this path.
 *
 * Clone-up safety (load-bearing, learned from the spike): a fresh material is
 * created and the base is copied into it via
 * THREE.MeshStandardMaterial.prototype.copy.call(clone, base). Two crashes are
 * dodged this way:
 *   (a) MeshPhysicalMaterial.copy(standardSource) reads physical-only fields
 *       (clearcoatNormalScale, attenuationColor, ...) off the standard source and
 *       throws "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'x')". Routing
 *       through MeshStandardMaterial.prototype.copy only copies the standard
 *       fields both share.
 *   (b) Material.copy does JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(userData)), which throws on
 *       the THREE.Texture objects in userData.morphic.resolvedTextures. So the
 *       base's userData is cleared across the copy, then the ORIGINAL userData
 *       object is assigned to the clone BY REFERENCE (shared morphic extras,
 *       treated as immutable -- we only write material properties, never through
 *       userData.morphic).
 *
 * We clone up to MeshPhysicalMaterial only when physical features are needed
 * (F_GLASS, or F_SHEEN on a physical source); otherwise a MeshStandardMaterial
 * clone is sufficient. The choice is made once, up front, from the morphic flags.
